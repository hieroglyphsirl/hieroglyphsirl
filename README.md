# Hieroglyphs in Real Life

HieroglyphsIRL is a new project that will provide a free, online, public-facing hieroglyphic sign list with links to photos and museum objects.

Its purpose is to enable students and scholars to look up the real-world counterparts of hieroglyphic signs.

## Motivation

Many hieroglyphs depict objects that were commonly known to ancient Egyptians, but which are unfamiliar in the modern world.
