# Hieroglyphs in Real Life

HieroglyphsIRL is a new project that will provide a free, online, public-facing hieroglyphic sign list with links to photos and museum objects.

Its purpose is to enable students and scholars to look up the real-world counterparts of hieroglyphic signs.

## Motivation

Many hieroglyphs depict objects that were commonly known to ancient Egyptians, but which are unfamiliar in the modern world.

For example, the sign ð“Š« depicts a headrestâ€”basically the ancient Egyptian equivalent of a pillowâ€”but it would be difficult to know this on sight because headrests are not common in our world. A quick look at museum collections shows that they were very common in ancient Egypt. So common that many have survived to the present day, such as this example from the Met:
