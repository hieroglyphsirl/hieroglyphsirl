# Hieroglyphs in Real Life

HieroglyphsIRL is a new project that will provide a free, online, public-facing hieroglyphic sign list with links to photos and museum objects.

Its purpose is to enable students and scholars to look up the real-world counterparts of hieroglyphic signs.

## Motivation

Many hieroglyphs depict objects that were commonly known to ancient Egyptians, but which are unfamiliar in the modern world.

For example, the sign ð“Š« depicts a headrestâ€”the ancient Egyptian equivalent of a pillowâ€”but it would be difficult to guess this on sight because headrests are not common in our world. A quick look at museum collections shows that headrests were very common in ancient Egypt. So common that many have survived to the present day, such as this example from the Met ([Headrest of Harmose](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/549018)):
![headrest](https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/549018/1712596/main-image)

By contrast, a symbol such as ðŸ“· would probably be incomprehensible to an ancient Egyptian scribe, but we can immediately recognize it as a camera.

The purpose of this project is to make the objects depicted in hieroglyphs as recognizable to readers today as they were to the ancient Egyptians.

## Linked Open Data

When completed, this project will provide stable, permanent endpoints for each sign entry. Researchers are welcomed and encouraged to link their projects to this one.

Simultaneously, this project will link to other important online sources, such as:

- [The Thot Sign List](https://thotsignlist.org)
- [The Polychrome Hieroglyphs Research Project (PHRP)](https://www.phrp.be)
